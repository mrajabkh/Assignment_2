INTRO
    I have officially started my second assigment. I plan on learning the tool React as I have recently been elected an executive position in a society 
where I will need to work with websites.

Beginning of WEEK 1
    My plan is to spend this first week finding tutorials and courses online whether on udemy or youtube to first learn the basics.

Beginning of WEEK 2
    Having spent the first week watching tutorials on youtube about react to learn the basics I feel as though I have gained an understanding of the basics though having knowledge
of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript beforehand definetely helped. I now intend to learn using a course I found online hoping it proves to be useful. The course itself advertises the 
fact that it is meant to teach through projects which I personally believeto be a more efficient way of learning espescially since the information will be easier to retain if I 
have some experience with it. Throughout the next week I will also clean up this log and repository making it much nicer and easier to navigate as currently the log is not very
clear.

End of Week 3
    I spent the whole of week 3 completing my very first tic tac toe project and believe a have a much more solid understanding of the basics and the benefits of react.

Beginning of Week 4
    I plan on hopefully spending this week remaking my News Article from Assignment 1 into React as a form of showing how much progress I've made. I do believe I will definetely
struggle but I think it is something I will be able to do with some time. I plan on creating my learners guide during week 6 when I have the most knowledge about React as 
currently I don't think I could or should make a guide when I too am very much a beginner. As for the collabarative project I hope to start it once I've finished my current one.
If all goes to plan I will be start it around week 5.

Beginning of Week 5
    I am nearly done with remaking the news article from assignment 1, it has unfortunately taken longer than I expected due to a small misunderstanding in react code and 
Eid celebrations. However, I expect to finish it within the week and start the collaborative project. I have talked to fellow coursemate Jin and together we have decided
to build a calculator project. We expect to start it once I finish my current project and we decide how to split the work.

Week 6
    Over the past week and a half I have finished both the news article and the collabarative project. I intend on spending the last few days just tidying up my log and    
creating a guide for other learners.
