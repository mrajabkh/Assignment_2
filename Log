INTRO
    I have officially started my second assigment. I plan on learning the tool React as I have recently been elected an executive position in a society 
where I will need to work with websites.

WEEK 1
    My plan is to spend this first week finding tutorials and courses online whether on udemy or youtube to first learn the basics.

WEEK 2
    Having spent the first week watching tutorials on youtube about react to learn the basics I feel as though I have gained an understanding of the basics though having knowledge
of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript beforehand definetely helped. I now intend to learn using a course I found online hoping it proves to be useful. The course itself advertises the 
fact that it is meant to teach through projects which I personally believeto be a more efficient way of learning espescially since the information will be easier to retain if I 
have some experience with it. Throughout the next week I will also clean up this log and repository making it much nicer and easier to navigate as currently the log is not very
clear.
