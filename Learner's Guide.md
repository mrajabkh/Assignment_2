### What is React?
  React is a JavaScript library primarily used for web development.

### Why learn React?
  A multitude of reasons, it is very useful in terms of code reusability, performance, user experience, mobile app development, scalibility, and flexibility.

### Do I need any prerequisites to learning React?
  Yes unfortunately you do. As it is a JavaScript library you would need to know a JavaScript first and preferably a handful of HTML and while CSS is technically not needed for any project you make you will be using CSS to style the website so it too is recommended. To know whether you know enough JavaScript to start learning React I recommend watching this short [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR9wsVYp8RQ).

### An Evaluation of React
Assuming you already know JavaScript, HTML and CSS which most webdevs do learning React is more or less a simple feat that isn't too time consuming espescially considering the benefits. However, if you do not know those 3 previous languages it simply isn't worthwhile to learn React straight away as you likely simple aren't ready for it. React does also have alternatives such as Vue, Angular, or Svelte. And while these aren't as popular as React they are still quite popular and useful in their own regards. For example, a certain project might be better suited towards Angular rather than React. Nonetheless, my recommendation is to learn React since it is the most widely used and for a reason.

## How to learn React
  While there are many ways to learn React, I would like to mention that this is just my personal recommendation based on my personal experience and knowledge. I am not claiming this method to be the best method however I do believe it to be a suitable one.

  Assuming you meet all the pre-requisites, I would first recommend watching a tutorial on react, simply go on youtube and search 'react tutorial'. You will see a heap of options
I recommend choosing one you like and to be satisfied with the length because the worst thing you could do right now is to overcommit and pick a video that's too long where you
will get extremely bored and just give up. If you're looking for a shorter video I personally recommend this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eMGE7QtTk&pp=ygUOcmVhY3QgdHV0b3JpYWw%3D).
However, if you're willing to watch a little bit more and go a bit more in depth I would recommend this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d).
And if you unlike me really love watching tutorials you could always go the extra mile and watch both and while it isn't needed it is still helpful nonetheless.

I recommend taking your time watching the tutorials, take breaks if you need them since getting burnt out is the worst thing that could happen. Now, once you've finished the video
or videos I recommend following along this [project tutorial](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). That runs through the project in pretty good depth and gives you the
opportunity to improve upon the project in the end. If you are however feeling confident you could always try and go a bit ahead of the tutorial and compare their code to yours.
I do not recommend going too far ahead though as if you're code becomes too different you won't be able to follow along anymore.

Once, you're done with that I recommend you keep taking the project route. Find something you're interested in, something you want to build and do it because having an actual interest in it will make you much more inclined to do it. If you're struggling with ideas I recommend something from this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZdHfJVAY-s) or this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ&list=PLillGF-RfqbY3c2r0htQyVbDJJoBFE6Rb&index=5). If you intend to use this skill for a job of some sort I recommend doing a project that will look good on your C.V. becuase while React is interesting and useful, I doubt most people are learning it if not for a future job.
