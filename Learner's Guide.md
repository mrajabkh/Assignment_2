What is React?
  React is a JavaScript library primarily used for web development.

Why learn React?
  A multitude of reasons, it is very useful in terms of code reusability, performance, user experience, mobile app development, scalibility, and flexibility.

Do I need any prerequisites to learning React?
  Yes unfortunately you do. As it is a JavaScript library you would need to know a JavaScript first and preferably a handful of HTML and while CSS is technically not needed for 
any project you make you will be using CSS to style the website so it too is recommended. To know whether you know enough JavaScript to start learning React I recommend watching
this short youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR9wsVYp8RQ).

How to learn React
  While there are many ways to learn React, I would like to mention that this is just my personal recommendation based on my personal experience and knowledge. I am not claiming
this method to be the best method however I do believe it to be a suitable one.

  Assuming you meet all the pre-requisites, I would first recommend watching a tutorial on react, simply go on youtube and search 'react tutorial'. You will see a heap of options
I recommend choosing one you like and to be satisfied with the length because the worst thing you could do right now is to overcommit and pick a video that's too long where you
will get extremely bored and just give up. If you're looking for a shorter video I personally recommend https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9eMGE7QtTk&pp=ygUOcmVhY3QgdHV0b3JpYWw%3D.
However, if you're willing to watch a little bit more and go a bit more in depth I would recommend this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j942wKiXFu8&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gZD-Tvwfod2gaISzfRiP9d.
And if you unlike me really love watching tutorials you could always go the extra mile and watch both and while it isn't needed it is still helpful nonetheless.

I recommend taking your time watching the tutorials, take breaks if you need them since getting burnt out is the worst thing that could happen. Now, once you've finished the video
or videos I recommend following along this project tutorial (https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe). That runs through the project in pretty good depth and gives you the
opportunity to improve upon the project in the end. If you are however feeling confident you could always try and go a bit ahead of the tutorial and compare their code to yours.
I do not recommend going too far ahead though as if you're code becomes too different you won't be able to follow along anymore.
